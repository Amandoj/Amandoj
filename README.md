## About Me!!
I'm an energetic 3rd year college student currently attending the University of California, San Diego and majoring in Data Science. I am currently focused on improving my python skills, learning SQL, doing projects, etc. Some of my favorite things to do are listen to music (primarily Indie :headphones:), playing video games :video_game:, playing/watching sports (Lakers fan since 2001!!! :basketball:) and reading.
